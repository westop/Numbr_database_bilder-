# Numbr_database_bilder-
The program was created for the practical purposes of sales companies
with the goals of easy and safe creation of databases of numbers at home :)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use?
To launch, go to the file directory (...\hello_ide\target\debug\) hold down 
the shift and click the mouse 2 on the free space, then select open in 
PowerShell, insert the following (./Numbr_database_bilder +38095 +38063) 
replace the number codes with your own (Support Ukr numbers) after which 
the application will generate a dictionary from the numbers in the same directory.
The whole process takes about an hour and gives a 250 MB file for each value transferred (+38095 +38063)

Why are not databases used, but txt ?
Not every company can afford to use expensive equipment for calling subscribers,
and as a result, not all equipment can take values from database cells, 
but txt and entering numbers line by line solve this issue, 
allowing almost any equipment to process phone number dictionaries
